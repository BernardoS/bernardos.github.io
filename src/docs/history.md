  I'm a 24 years old Brazillian and my current professional passion is front-end web development. It all started when I was properly introduced to computer science when I was 17, and to be honest, I still know no **shit** (yeah, I curse...), about CS.

  I'm not gonna lie here. Yes, I entered the CS graduation because I wanted to make games ðŸ˜… (silly me). Have I learned how to make games? Well (nooope)... I know [OpenGL](https://www.opengl.org/), thanks to CG classes, and I actually __did__ a little silly game as evaluation in CG, but boy I definetly didn't like! Never have I been so wrong about something I wanted in my life! CG sucks! (my humble opinion here folks...). It never ocurred to me web development, I couldn't actually care less about it. To be honest as a 17 yo boy, I didn't care about a lot of shits, including what would become of me professionaly speaking. Oh silly boy was I, enjoying the spoils of life as they come and go and never stoping to think about how would tomorrow be. Well time passed and maturity eventually hit me in the face!

  As a CS student in a federal university back in Brazil you're encouraged to learn more about logic, data structure, how languages work, numerical algorithms, algorithms analyses and etc (basic computer science bullshit that we love), but unfortunately, there's not much about development itself. I guess it's fitting, after all, it's not an Information Systems bachelor. Frustrating nevertheless, after all, I'd spend 5 years studying how to structure stacks, heaps and graphs but I wouldn't have one semester to learn how to run a simple HTTP server ðŸ˜­.

  My lemon was BRANETEC (**Bra**zil **Ne**therlands **Tec**hnology) program (Basically an exchange program for the period of one year) back in 2014. So there I was for the first time in Europe in a small town called [Assen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assen) in a small center of a Dutch ðŸ‡³ðŸ‡± university called [Hanze](https://www.hanze.nl/eng) for one year to __"learn"__ how to work with sensors, automation bullshit and stuffs that had basically nothing to do with CS itself (not directly), and there in the midst of all those numbers, frequency and z transforms boring stuff came the unexpected, **JavaScript**. In a little 6 month project I ended up in a team to develop a machine involving sensors to collect data from urine, and someone had to deal with front-end bullshit (barely knew that front-end was way more than just V in the MVC pattern that I've previously learned about) and since I wasn't really into sensors it ended up being a whatever I'll do it task.

  Here I am now, 4 years later, in love with this great ever evolving echosystem. Never have I been more resolved in what I want to do professionally as I am now.
