I'm (almost! :pray:) a computer scientist and currently working as a front-end web dev.

My passion is to (refactor code! <3 joking, joking...) work with this amazing chaotic ever changing and evolving environment that we call internet, to solve problems.

## About

I'm a 23 years old Brazillian and I've been introduced to this awkward, and not so popular among normal people, environment that we call computer science (and it's relatives: IT, systems of information, etc...) about 5 years ago and to be honest I still know no **shit** (yeah, I swear... A lot).

As a computer scientist in a federal university back in Brazil you're encouraged to learn more about logic, data structure, how languages work, numerical algorithms, algorithms analyses and etc (basic computer science bullshit that we love). But about 3 years ago I was shocked to discover that there was **NOTHING** :scream: about web in my university curricular grade.

That was ground breaking for me! I was like __WTF__?! You can literally spend 5 years studying how to structure a stack and a heap and graphs bullshit but you don't have 2 freaking semesters to learn how to run a simple HTTP server?!?! **WHAT**? Of course back then I didn't even know how things worked also.
