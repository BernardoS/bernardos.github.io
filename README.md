> No i'll not fix your computer! not joking! - said every computer scientist ever...

I'm (almost! :pray:) a computer scientist and currently working as a front-end web dev.

My passion is to (refactor code! <3 joking, joking...) work with this amazing chaotic ever changing and evolving environment that we call internet, to solve problems.

## About me!

  I'm a 23 years old Brazillian and I've been introduced to this awkward, and not so popular among normal people, environment that we call computer science (and it's relatives: IT, systems of information, etc...) about 5 years ago and to be honest I still know no **shit** (yeah, I swear... A lot).

  As a computer scientist in a federal university back in Brazil you're encouraged to learn more about logic, data structure, how languages work, numerical algorithms, algorithms analyses and etc (basic computer science bullshit that we love). But about 3 years ago I was shocked to discover that there was **NOTHING** :scream: about web in my university curricular grade.

  That was ground breaking for me! I was like __WTF__?! You can literally spend 5 years studying how to structure a stack and a heap and graphs bullshit (just kidding, that shit is important as fuck :+1:) but you don't have 1 freaking semester to learn how to run a simple HTTP server? **WHAT**?

  Of course back then I didn't even know how things worked also. It turned out that there were not enough resources in the university technology center to structure a grade that supports all the fundamentals for the course and still teaches important stuff for the practical life, so they had to make some budget decisions, and there goes my web future :sob:.
  
  **Well, it happens that when life gives you lemons... you should make a lemonade!**
  
  My lemon was BRANETEC (**Bra**zil **Ne**therlands **Tec**hnology) program (Basically an exchange program for the period of one year), so there I was for the first time in Europe in a small town called [Assen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assen) in a small center of a big ass Duth university called [Hanze](https://www.hanze.nl/eng) for one year to "learn" how to work with sensors, automation bullshit and stuffs that had basically nothing to do with CS itself (not directly).
