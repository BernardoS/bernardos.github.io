## About me!

  I'm a 23 years old Brazillian and I've been introduced to this awkward, and not so popular among normal people, environment that we call computer science (and it's relatives: IT, systems of information, etc...) about 5 years ago and to be honest I still know no **shit** (yeah, I swear...).

  As a computer scientist in a federal university back in Brazil you're encouraged to learn more about logic, data structure, how languages work, numerical algorithms, algorithms analyses and etc (basic computer science bullshit that we love). But about 3 years ago I was shocked to discover that there was **NOTHING** about web in my university curricular grade :scream:.

  That was ground breaking for me! I was like __WTF__?! You can literally spend 5 years studying how to structure a stack and a heap and graphs bullshit (just kidding, that shit is important as fuck :+1:) but you don't have 1 freaking semester to learn how to run a simple HTTP server? **WHAT**? The best you got is some Java RMI...

  Of course back then I didn't even know how things worked also. It turned out that there were not enough resources in the university technology center to structure a grade that supports all the fundamentals for the course and still teaches important stuff for the practical life, so they had to make some budget decisions, and there goes my web future :sob:.
  
  **Well, it happens that when life gives you lemons... you should make a lemonade!**
  
  My lemon was BRANETEC (**Bra**zil **Ne**therlands **Tec**hnology) program (Basically an exchange program for the period of one year), so there I was for the first time in Europe in a small town called [Assen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assen) in a small center of a big ass Dutch university called [Hanze](https://www.hanze.nl/eng) for one year to "learn" how to work with sensors, automation bullshit and stuffs that had basically nothing to do with CS itself (not directly), and there in the midst of all those numbers, frequency and z transforms boring stuff came the unexpected, **JavaScript**.
  
  In a little 6 month project I ended up in a team to develop a machine involving sensors to collect data from urine, and someone had to deal with front-end bullshit (barely knew that front-end was way more than just V in the MVC pattern) and since I wasn't really into sensors it ended up being a whatever I'll do it task.

  Here I am now, almost 3 years later, in love with this great ever evolving echosystem.
